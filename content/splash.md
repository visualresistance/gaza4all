# Welcome

This map is meant for you to get a better sense of the size of **Gaza** and the **West Bank** by placing their outlines over the places you know. The ongoing destruction of Gaza and the genocide and displacement of Palestinians is unimaginable. Try, for a moment, to see yourself in Gaza.

<!-- Optional image: uncomment and replace the path if you want to show one -->

**How to use**
- Click **Add Gaza here** or **Add West Bank here** to drop an outline at the current map center.  
- Use **Load Schools & Libraries** to add community institutions in the current view.  
- Use the **city menu** to jump to a preset location.  
- **Full Map** hides the right panel; **Hide buttons** hides the left controls (a small “Show sidebar” handle will appear to restore them).
