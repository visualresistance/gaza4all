# About

This project lets you drag the outlines of **Gaza** and the **West Bank** over any city to get a felt sense of scale.

- Click **Add Gaza here** or **Add West Bank here** to place the outline at the current map center.
- Use **Load Schools & Libraries** to add community institutions in the current view.
- Use the city dropdown to jump to a preset. Anyone can add their own city in `config.js`.

This site is intentionally simple so educators and organizers can **fork it** and customize the sidebar content and presets without changing any JavaScript.
