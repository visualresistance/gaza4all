# About

This project invites you to better understand and connect with Palestine and the Palestinian people through maps, data, and other resources. 

Take outlines of **Gaza** and the **West Bank** and place them over any city or area to get a better sense of the how large these areas are and what they might look like in comparison and relation to your own neigbhorhoods and lived experiences. 

- Click **Add Gaza here** or **Add West Bank here** to place the outline at the current map center.
- Use **Load Schools & Libraries** to add community institutions in the current view.
- Use the city dropdown to jump to another city or simply move the map to your location. 

This site is intentionally simple so educators and organizers can **fork it** and customize the sidebar content and presets without changing any JavaScript. Anyone can add their own city in `config.js`.

This site will continue to grow with materials and resources.
